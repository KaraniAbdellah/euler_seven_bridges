The Seven Bridges of KÃ¶nigsberg ðŸ§©

History ðŸ“œ
The Seven Bridges of KÃ¶nigsberg was a puzzle from the 18th century. The city (now Kaliningrad, Russia) had seven bridges connecting different areas. The challenge was to walk across all bridges without repeating any. Many tried, but no one could solve it.



Eulerâ€™s Proposition ðŸ”¢
In 1736, mathematician Leonhard Euler solved the puzzle by creating graph theory. He showed that itâ€™s impossible to walk across all the bridges without repeating because each area (or point) must have an even number of bridges. Since the bridges in KÃ¶nigsberg didn't follow this rule, it was impossible to find such a path.
